# packr-rs

A port of [packr](https://github.com/libgdx/packr) written in rust-lang. Uses [jni-rs](https://github.com/code-disaster/jni-rs) to access the Java Invocation API.

This code was written as an experiment to get familiar with the Rust language and with Cargo, how to interface with C/C++, and how to integrate native code.

> This port is not complete. It only runs on Mac OS X so far. It doesn't implement all features available in the original.

> Disclaimer: This is one part of the very first code I've ever written in Rust. It's probably very ugly. No kittens were harmed while writing this code.
